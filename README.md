Exercises for the course "Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition TEL 311"

## Exercises:

>   <a href = "https://github.com/atzel-ov/PatternRecognition/tree/main/SET1/Exercise1">Bayesian Decision Theory</a> - finding the decision boundary that minimizes the probability of the error

>   <a href = "https://github.com/atzel-ov/PatternRecognition/tree/main/SET1/Exercise2">Bayesian Classification</a> - computing the aspect ratio of the digits 1 & 2 and using it as the random variable we develop a bayesian classifier
